Create "QR Inspector" - a single-file QR code scanner (index.html) with inline CSS/JS. No frameworks.

Core Features:
- Real-time camera QR scanning with start/stop controls
- URL safety analysis: HTTPS check, phishing indicators, URL shorteners, suspicious TLDs
- Full URL metadata display: protocol, domain, path, query params
- Scan history with localStorage (offline-first, persists across sessions)
- Copy to clipboard, clear history, confirm before opening links

Enhanced Features:
- Duplicate scan detection with notification
- Manual URL input for analysis without camera
- Search/filter history
- Export/import history as JSON
- Visual feedback on successful scan
- Delete individual history items
- Scan statistics dashboard
- Dark mode (system preference detection)

Security Checks:
- Homograph attack detection
- Base64-encoded URLs flagging
- IP address vs domain identification
- Tracking parameter identification

UX Requirements:
- Mobile-responsive
- Keyboard navigation + ARIA labels
- Error handling for camera permission denial
- Loading states
- iOS Safari + Android Chrome compatible

Technical:
- Single HTML file, inline CSS/JS only
- Use native APIs (no external dependencies except QR library)
- PWA-ready (add manifest for "Add to Home Screen")
- Efficient scanning (pause when not in view to save battery)
